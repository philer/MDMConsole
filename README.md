MDMConsole
========
A JS console for MDM's webkit greeter built in HTML.

### !!! This is not a regular theme. Don't use it unless you know what you're doing !!!

This “Theme” provides a simple JavaScript console that can be used to understand
and to debug MDM's theme API.
If you're going to use it make sure you know at least how to log in with MDM using only JavaScript.
